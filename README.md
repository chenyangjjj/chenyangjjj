### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am 3-rd year master student at UESTC, one month left to graduate. Interning in Shenzhen bay labortory.

Fucking my master supervisor, Fucking Myself. Fucking research.

I wish my life will be in order and keep moving forward. But opposite, I am trapped by myself, Maybe I will be a dead man in one month or not.
