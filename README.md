### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am 3-rd year master student at UESTC, one month left to graduate. Interning in Shenzhen bay labortory.

Fucking Myself. Fucking research. Fucking damn voice in the brain. Fucking my desire rising from the brain, I am not able to handle it. 

I wish my life will be in order and keep moving forward. But opposite, I am trapped by myself, Maybe I will be a dead man in one month, or not.
